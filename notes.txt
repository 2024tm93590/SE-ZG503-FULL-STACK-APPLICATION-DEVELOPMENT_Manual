Phase 1: Manual Development
Backend Development
Set up the backend framework:
Choose a backend framework (Node.js, Python, Java, or .NET).
Set up the project structure.
Implement APIs:
Create REST or GraphQL APIs for the following:
User Authentication (Login/Signup with roles: student, staff, admin).
Equipment Management (CRUD operations for equipment).
Borrowing and Return Requests (Create, approve/reject, mark as returned).
Dashboard (List/search/filter equipment).
Ensure proper validation and error handling.
Database:
Design and implement the database schema (SQL/NoSQL).
Tables/collections for users, equipment, borrowing requests, etc.
API Documentation:
Document the APIs using Swagger, Postman, or markdown.

Frontend Development
Set up React:
Initialize a React project.
Set up routing for navigation.
Design UI Components:
Create components for login/signup, equipment listing, borrowing requests, etc.
Ensure responsiveness and user-friendly design.
State Management:
Use React state or a library like Redux for managing application state.
Integrate with Backend:
Connect the frontend with the backend APIs.
Integration
Test the integration between the frontend and backend.
Ensure proper communication and data flow.



Phase 2: AI-Assisted Development
Rebuild or Enhance:
Use AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor) to rebuild or improve the system.
Examples:
Generate boilerplate code.
Refactor existing code for better quality.
Debug issues.
Document AI Usage:
Record prompts and completions.
Note which parts were AI-generated and which were manually coded.
Reflect on the AI-assisted workflow.
Additional Enhancements (For 3-4 Member Groups)
Choose one enhancement:
Due date tracking and overdue notifications.
Request history and usage analytics.
Damage/repair log for equipment maintenance.
Implement the chosen feature.
Deliverables
Source Code:
Two GitHub repositories: Phase 1 (manual) and Phase 2 (AI-assisted).
Documentation:
API documentation, database schema, architecture, component hierarchy, assumptions, and wireframes.
Demonstration Video:
Record and upload a video showing the working prototype for both phases.
AI Usage Log and Reflection Report:
Include prompts, completions, and reflections on AI usage.
Evaluation Criteria
Backend APIs (CRUD, validation, docs).
Frontend UI (navigation, interactivity).
Integration between frontend and backend.
Additional enhancements (if applicable).
AI usage log and reflection.
Code quality, Git commit history, and submission quality.
